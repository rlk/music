<li>
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping</br>
I dreamt I held you in my arms.</br>
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken</br>
So I hung my head, and I cried.
</li>
<li>
I'll always love you and make you happy</br>
If you will only say the same.</br>
But if you leave me to love another,</br>
You'll regret it all one day.
</li>
<li>
You told me once, dear, you really loved me</br>
And no one else could come between.</br>
But now you've left me and love another.</br>
You have shattered all of my dreams.
</li>
<li>
In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me.</br>
When I awake my poor heart pains.</br>
So when you come back and make me happy,</br>
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.
