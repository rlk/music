<li>
There was music, there was singing, people listened everywhere.</br>
The people they were smiling, so happy to be there.</br>
While on the road behind us, the fascists waited there.</br>
Their curses could not drown out the music in the air.
</li>
<li>
The grounds were all surrounded by a band of gallant men.</br>
Shoulder to shoulder, no fascist could get in.</br>
The music of the people was heard for miles around,</br>
Well guarded by the workers, their courage made us proud.
</li>
<li>
When the music was all over, we started to go home.</br>
We did not know the trouble and the pain that was to come.</br>
We got into our buses and drove out through the gate,</br>
And saw the gangster police, their faces filled with hate.
</li>
<li>
Then without any warning the rocks began to come.</br>
The cops and troopers laughed to see the damage that was done.</br>
They ran us through a gauntlet, to their everlasting shame.</br>
And the cowards there attacked us, damnation to their name.
</li>
<li>
All across the nation the people heard the tale,</br>
And marveled at the concert, and knew we had not failed.</br>
We shed our blood at Peekskill, and suffered many a pain,</br>
But we beat back the fascists and we'll beat them back again!
