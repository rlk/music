W: There was music, there was singing, people listened everywhere.
W: The people they were smiling, so happy to be there.
W: While on the road behind us, the fascists waited there.
W: Their curses could not drown out the music in the air.
W:
W: The grounds were all surrounded by a band of gallant men.
W: Shoulder to shoulder, no fascist could get in.
W: The music of the people was heard for miles around,
W: Well guarded by the workers, their courage made us proud.
W:
W: When the music was all over, we started to go home.
W: We did not know the trouble and the pain that was to come.
W: We got into our buses and drove out through the gate,
W: And saw the gangster police, their faces filled with hate.
W:
W: Then without any warning the rocks began to come.
W: The cops and troopers laughed to see the damage that was done.
W: They ran us through a gauntlet, to their everlasting shame.
W: And the cowards there attacked us, damnation to their name.
W:
W: All across the nation the people heard the tale,
W: And marveled at the concert, and knew we had not failed.
W: We shed our blood at Peekskill, and suffered many a pain,
W: But we beat back the fascists and we'll beat them back again!
