<li>
Old von Hindenburg and his Royal German Army,<br>
They are tramps in tatters and in rags.<br>
Uncle Sammy has tied every nation in this world<br>
In his long old leather money bags.
</li>
<li>
Wilson caught a trip and a train into Paris,<br>
Meetin' Lloyd George and Mr. Clemenceau.<br>
They said to Mr. Wilson, &ldquo;We've staked off our claims,<br>
There is nothing else for you.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>
&ldquo;I plowed more lands, I built bigger factories,<br>
And I stopped Hindenburg in his tracks.<br>
You thank the Yanks by claiming all the lands,<br>
But you still owe your money to my bank.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>
&ldquo;Keep sending your ships across these waters;<br>
We'll borrow all the money you can lend.<br>
We must buy new clothes, new plows, and factories,<br>
And we need golden dollars for to spend.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>
Every dollar in the world, well, it rolled and it rolled,<br>
And it rolled into Uncle Sammy's door.<br>
A few got richer, and richer, and richer,<br>
But the poor folks kept a-getting poor.
</li>
<li>
Well, the workers in the world did fight a revolution<br>
To chase out the gamblers from their land.<br>
Farmers, and peasants, and workers in the city<br>
Fought together on their five-year plans.
</li>
<li>
The soul and the spirit of the workers' revolution<br>
Spread across every nation in this world;<br>
From Italy to China, to Europe and to India,<br>
And the blood of the workers it did spill.
</li>
<li>
This spirit split the wind to Boston, Massachusetts,<br>
With Coolidge on the Governor's chair.<br>
Troopers and soldiers, the guards and the spies<br>
Fought the workers that brought the spirit there.
</li>
<li>
Sacco and Vanzetti had preached to the workers,<br>
They was carried up to Old Judge Thayer.<br>
They was charged with killing the payroll guards,<br>
And they died in the Charlestown chair.
</li>
<li>
Well, the world shook harder on the night they died,<br>
Than was shaken by that great World War.<br>
More millions did march for Sacco and Vanzetti<br>
Than did march for the great war lords.
</li>
<li>
Well, the peasants, the farmers, the towns and the cities,<br>
And the hills and the valleys they did ring.<br>
Hindenburg and Wilson, Harding, Hoover, Coolidge,<br>
Never heard this many voices sing.
</li>
<li>
The zig-zag lightning, the rumbles of the thunder,<br>
And the singing of the clouds blowing by,<br>
The flood and the storm for Sacco and Vanzetti<br>
Caused the rich man to pull his hair and cry.
</li>
