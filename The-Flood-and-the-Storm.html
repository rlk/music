W: Old von Hindenburg and his Royal German Army,

W: In his long old leather money bags.
W:
W: Wilson caught a trip and a train into Paris,
W: Meetin’ Lloyd George and Mr. Clemenceau.
W: They said to Mr. Wilson, “We’ve staked off our claims,
W: There is nothing else for you.”
W:
W: “I plowed more lands, I built bigger factories,
W: And I stopped Hindenburg in his tracks.
W: You thank the Yanks by claiming all the lands,
W: But you still owe your money to my bank.”
W:
W: “Keep sending your ships across these waters;
W: We’ll borrow all the money you can lend.
W: We must buy new clothes, new plows, and factories,
W: And we need golden dollars for to spend.”

W:
W: Well, the peasants, the farmers, the towns and the cities,
W: And the hills and the valleys they did ring.
W: Hindenburg and Wilson, Harding, Hoover, Coolidge,
W: Never heard this many voices sing.
W:
W: The zig-zag lightning, the rumbles of the thunder,
W: And the singing of the clouds blowing by,
W: The flood and the storm for Sacco and Vanzetti
W: Caused the rich man to pull his hair and cry.
