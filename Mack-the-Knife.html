When the shark bites with his teeth, dear,<br>
scarlet billows start to spread.<br>
Fancy gloves though wears Macheath, dear,<br>
so there's not a trace of red.

On the sidewalk, Sunday mornin', baby,<br>
lies a body, oozin' life.<br>
Someone's sneakin' around the corner.<br>

From a tugboat, by the river<br>
