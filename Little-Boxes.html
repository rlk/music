And the people in the houses</br>
All went to the university,</br>
Where they were put in boxes</br>
And they came out all the same,</br>
And there's doctors and lawyers,</br>
And business executives,</br>
And they're all made out of ticky tacky</br>
And they all look just the same.
</li>
<li>
And they all play on the golf course</br>
And drink their martinis dry,</br>
And they all have pretty children</br>
And the children go to school,</br>
And the children go to summer camp</br>
And then to the university,</br>
Where they are put in boxes</br>
And they come out all the same.
</li>
<li>
And the boys go into business</br>
And marry and raise a family</br>
In boxes made of ticky tacky</br>
And they all look just the same.</br>
There's a pink one and a green one</br>
And a blue one and a yellow one,</br>
And they're all made out of ticky tacky</br>
And they all look just the same.
