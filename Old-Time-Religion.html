<li>
We will worship Aphrodite,</br>
She's beautiful but flighty*</br>
She wears that see-through nightie,</br>
And it's good enough for me.
</li>
<li>
We will pray with Zarathustra,</br>
We'll pray just like we use to,</br>
I'm a Zarathustra booster,</br>
And it's good enough for me.
</li>
<li>
We will pray with those Egyptians,</br>
Build pyramids to put our crypts in,</br>
Cover subways with inscriptions,</br>
And it's good enough for me.
</li>
<li>
We will pray with those old druids,</br>
They drink fermented fluids,</br>
Waltzing naked though the woo-ids,</br>
And it's good enough for me.
</li>
<li>
Hare Krishna, He must laugh on</br>
To see me dressed in saffron</br>
With my hair that's only half on</br>
And it's good enough for me.
</li>
<li>
I will rise at early morning,</br>
When my Lord gives me the warning,</br>
That the solar age is dawning,</br>
And that's good enough for me.
