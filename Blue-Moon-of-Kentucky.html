<p>This tune has no canonical key. Elvis did it in A. Munroe did it in B or C. There's a YouTube of LeAnn Rimes in D and of Ricky Scaggs in E. Recordings probably go all the way to Z. I choose C arbitrarily.</p>
<p>And, of course, tradition dictates the tune be sung once in a slow 3/4, with a musical interlude also in 3/4, followed by a 4/4 reprise at around 140 BPM.</p>
