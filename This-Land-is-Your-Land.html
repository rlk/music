w: wa-ters, this land _ was made for you and me.
W: As I was walking that ribbon of highway,
W: I saw above me that endless skyway.
W: I saw below me that golden valley.
W: This land was made for you and me.
W:
W: I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
W: To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts.
W: And all around me a voice was sounding:
W: This land was made for you and me.
W:
W: When the sun came shining, and I was strolling,
W: And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,
W: As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:
W: This land was made for you and me.
W:
W: As I went walking I saw a sign there,
W: And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."
W: But on the other side it didn't say nothing.
W: That side was made for you and me.
W:
W: In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,
W: By the relief office I seen my people.
W: As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,
W: Is this land made for you and me?
W:
W: Nobody living can ever stop me,
W: As I go walking that freedom highway.
W: Nobody living can ever make me turn back
W: This land was made for you and me.
