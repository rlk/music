As I was walking that ribbon of highway,</br>
I saw above me that endless skyway.</br>
I saw below me that golden valley.</br>
This land was made for you and me.
</li>
<li>
I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps</br>
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts.</br>
And all around me a voice was sounding:</br>
This land was made for you and me.
</li>
<li>
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling,</br>
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,</br>
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:</br>
This land was made for you and me.
</li>
<li>
As I went walking I saw a sign there,</br>
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."</br>
But on the other side it didn't say nothing.</br>
That side was made for you and me.
</li>
<li>
In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,</br>
By the relief office I seen my people.</br>
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,</br>
Is this land made for you and me?
</li>
<li>
Nobody living can ever stop me,</br>
As I go walking that freedom highway.</br>
Nobody living can ever make me turn back</br>
This land was made for you and me.
