w: On~the four-teenth day of Ap-ril _ of nine-teen thir-ty five. _ There
"E"B2c B2A|A3 G2E|"B7"F2E F2G|"E"E3- E2E|
w: struck the worst of dust storms that ev-er filled the sky. _ You~could
"A"E2A A2B|"E"cB2- B2B|B2B "B7"F2A|"E"G3- G2A|
w: see that dust storm com-in', _ the cloud looked death-like black, _ And
"E"B2c B2A|AG2- G2E|"B7"F2E F2G|"E"E3- E2z|
w: through our might-y na-tion, _ it left a dread-ful track.
W: From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,
W: Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,
W: It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,
W: We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.
W:
W: The radio reported, we listened with alarm,
W: The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm;
W: From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico,
W: They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw.
W:
W: From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell,
W: And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill.
W: From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong,
W: They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long.
W:
W: Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks,
W: And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks.
W: And the family it was crowded into their little room,
W: They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom.
W:
W: The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night,
W: When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight.
W: We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
W: Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown.
W:
W: It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns,
W: It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm.
W: We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in,
W: We rattled down that highway to never come back again.
