<li>
From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,</br>
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,</br>
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,</br>
We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.
</li>
<li>
The radio reported, we listened with alarm,</br>
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm;</br>
From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico,</br>
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw.
</li>
<li>
From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell,</br>
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill.</br>
From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong,</br>
They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long.
</li>
<li>
Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks,</br>
And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks.</br>
And the family it was crowded into their little room,</br>
They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom.
</li>
<li>
The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night,</br>
When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight.</br>
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown</br>
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown.
</li>
<li>
It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns,</br>
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm.</br>
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in,</br>
We rattled down that highway to never come back again.
