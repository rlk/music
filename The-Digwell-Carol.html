<li>
And bring you all your blighted crops and blighted beasts beside,<br>
And coffins of this season's dead that of the blight have died.<br>
Bring them to the mountain's top and fetch the boulders near,<br>
'Tis fitting that the blighted dead should all be buried here.
</li>
<li>
So fetch the boulders, sand, and stones, and pile them deeply here.<br>
We bury now the sorrows, sins, and bad luck of the year,<br>
And when the mountain's higher by the mound we build today,<br>
Then we shall feast and dance and sing this autumn night away.
</li>
<li>
For back in our forefathers' time, the devils ruled this land.<br>
They made cruel wars and laws to rule the folks on every hand.<br>
They spoiled the land and water, and they poisoned half the sky.<br>
They cared for nothing but their power, though man and nature die.
</li>
<li>
In time the danger grew so fierce it threatened them as well,<br>
And so they dug deep in the Earth and hid them safe in Hell.<br>
They hoped to wait in comfort 'til the poisons wore away,<br>
For then they could come out again and rule another day.
</li>
<li>
They hid themselves below the ground and left the people here,<br>
Amid the blight that they had made and even they must fear.<br>
But still the people stayed alive, and well they promised then<br>
That all the devils hid in Hell would never rule again.
</li>
<li>
And so our fathers hunted 'til they found the secret gate,<br>
And there they piled the boulders high above where devils wait,<br>
And thus we've ever after done these many years and more,<br>
So now our man-made mountain stands upon their exit door.
</li>
