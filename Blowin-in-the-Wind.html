How many years can a mountain exist<br>
Before it's washed to the sea?<br>
How many years can some people exist<br>
Before they're allowed to be free?<br>
How many times can a man turn his head<br>
Pretending he just doesn't see?<br>
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many times must a man look up<br>
Before he can really see the sky?<br>
How many ears must one man have<br>
Before he can hear people cry?<br>
How many deaths will it take till he knows<br>
That too many people have died?<br>
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
