C: Ann Taylor (1806)
N: Each of the verses of the original poem has four lines, but the common
N: arrangement has six. Personal preference dictates how to manage this difference.
N: I find the AB-CD-AB repetition so familiar on the first verse to be nonsensical
N: on later verses. The notated repeat permits the performance of all five verses with
N: a satisfying resolution on the last.

w: Twin-kle, twin-kle, lit-tle star, How I won-der what you are,
W: When the blazing sun is gone,
W: When he nothing shines upon,
W: Then you show your little light,
W: Twinkle, twinkle, through the night.
W:
W: Then the traveller in the dark
W: Thanks you for your tiny spark;
W: He could not see where to go,
W: If you did not twinkle so.
W:
W: In the dark blue sky you keep,
W: And often through my curtains peep,
W: For you never shut your eye
W: Till the sun is in the sky.
W:
W: As your bright and tiny spark
W: Lights the traveller in the dark,
W: Though I know not what you are,
W: Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
