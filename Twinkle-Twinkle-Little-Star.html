<li>
When the blazing sun is gone,</br>
When he nothing shines upon,</br>
Then you show your little light,</br>
Twinkle, twinkle, through the night.
</li>
<li>
Then the traveller in the dark</br>
Thanks you for your tiny spark;</br>
He could not see where to go,</br>
If you did not twinkle so.
</li>
<li>
In the dark blue sky you keep,</br>
And often through my curtains peep,</br>
For you never shut your eye</br>
Till the sun is in the sky.
</li>
<li>
As your bright and tiny spark</br>
Lights the traveller in the dark,</br>
Though I know not what you are,</br>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the verses of the original poem has four lines, but the common arrangement has six. Personal preference dictates how to manage this difference. I find the AB-CD-AB repetition so familiar on the first verse to be nonsensical on later verses. The notated repeat permits the performance of all five verses with a satisfying resolution on the last.</p>
