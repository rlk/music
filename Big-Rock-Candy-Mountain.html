<li>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains</br>
All the cops have wooden legs</br>
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth</br>
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs</br>
The farmers' trees are full of fruit</br>
And the barns are full of hay</br>
Oh I'm bound to go</br>
Where there ain't no snow</br>
Where the rain don't fall</br>
The winds don't blow</br>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
</li>
<li>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains</br>
You never change your socks</br>
And the little streams of alcohol</br>
Come a-trickling down the rocks</br>
The brakemen have to tip their hats</br>
And the railroad bulls are blind</br>
There's a lake of stew</br>
And of whiskey too</br>
You can paddle all around them</br>
In a big canoe</br>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
</li>
<li>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,</br>
The jails are made of tin.</br>
And you can walk right out again,</br>
As soon as you are in.</br>
There ain't no short-handled shovels,</br>
No axes, saws nor picks,</br>
I'm a-going to stay</br>
Where you sleep all day,</br>
Where they hung the jerk</br>
That invented work</br>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
