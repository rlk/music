<li>
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day</br>
As she rolled in the station you could hear all the people say</br>
There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall</br>
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
</li>
<li>
Our eastern states are dandies so the people always say</br>
From New York to St. Louis and Chicago by the way</br>
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall</br>
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
</li>
<li>
Here’s to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand</br>
And always be remembered 'round the courts of Alabama</br>
His earthly race is over and the curtains 'round him fall</br>
We'll carry home to victory on the Wabash Cannonball
</li>
<li>
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar</br>
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore</br>
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobos call</br>
You’re traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
</li>
